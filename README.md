Recommended PlanMyTrip app updates would be adding the weather description to the weather data, allowing users to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

From the list of potential travel destinations, the user can choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, the PlanMyTrip app will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
